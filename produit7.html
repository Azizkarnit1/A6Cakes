    <div class="first-p">I have been working on perfecting this recipe for some time and these have the right fluffy consistency using real ingredients (no jell-o needed), and they have intense blackberry-lemon flavor. P.S. that beautiful pinky-purple hue is all natural from fresh blackberries and makes these completely irresistible!</div>
    <h2 id="recepie">Ingredients for Blackberry Puree:</h2>
    <div class="ing"><ul>
        <li>2 cups (or 8 oz or 250 grams) blackberries.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar.</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice.</li>
        <li>1 egg white, room temperature</li>
    </ul></div>
    <h2>For the Agar Agar Syrup:</h2>
    <div class="ing"><ul>
        <li>1/3 cup (75 ml) water</li>
        <li>1 cup (200 grams) sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp (5 grams) agar agar*</li>
        <li>Powdered Sugar to dust</li>

    <h2>How to Make Homemade Marshmallows (Zephyr):</h2>
    <div class="how">
    <ol type="1">
        <li>In a medium saucepan, bring blackberries, 1/2 cup sugar and 1 Tbsp lemon juice to a simmer. Mash berries and simmer uncovered 10 min then strain through fine sieve, pressing on solids with a spatula. Scrape the back of the sieve to get 1/2 cup or 125 grams of puree. Chill the puree over an ice bath until cooled.</li>
        <li>Once puree is chilled and slightly thickened, combine it with 1 egg white in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with whisk.** Beat 8-10 min on high speed or until thick and stiff peaks form. While the blackberry/egg white mixture is whipping, proceed with step 3.</li>
        <img src="Homemade-Marshmallow-Zephyr-7-600x900.jpg">
        <li>In a medium sauce pan, combine 1/3 cup water, 2 tsp agar agar and 1 cup sugar. Place over medium heat, bring to boil then reduce heat to a low boil and cook 5 min, whisking constantly until syrup has thickened and pours from a spoon without dribbling. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>With mixer on the LOWEST speed, and as soon as agar syrup is off the stove, immediately pour it in a thin stream into the whipped blackberry mixture. Avoid getting syrup on whisk and bowl. Scrape down the bowl and beat another 2-3 minutes on high speed until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <img src="Homemade-Marshmallow-Zephyr-8-600x900.jpg">
        <li>Right away, transfer to a piping bag fitted with a Wilton 1M large open star tip and pipe roses onto parchment-lined baking sheet, keeping them even in width/size.</li>
        <img src="Homemade-Marshmallow-Zephyr-2-600x900.jpg">
        <li>Let stand in a draft free, low humidity, room temperature (70˚F) area, uncovered 6-12 hours, or overnight. Marshmallows will form a glossy film on top and will come off the parchment fairly easily, then match 2 halves together and roll sandwiched marshmallows in powdered sugar.</li>
